This repository hosts passwords collected from Indian Credential Leaks.

**Why I compiled this list?**

The standard dictionalies like rockyou, dark0de are not inefficient to crack Indian Passwords.
It contains majority passwords that people in my country (India ❤️) would never use.

So that leaves two options :

> 1. Generate specific wordlists for your cracking purpose. There are many great tools available for same. 
   Read about weakpass - https://kalilinuxtutorials.com/weakpass/

> 2. Use the real Passwords used by Indians on various platforms.
   There have been many data breches which exposed the passwords of Indians.
   I have just combined all of them and made a huge text file lol 😉
